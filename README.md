# Project 1 - ordinary differential equations #
### *A project for laboratory classes in ordinary differential equations - the basics.* ###

The first part of the final project in laboratories on ordinary differential equations. 
The project was created using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

### Tasks descriptions ###

1. Create the graph of the 17th derivative of the function $f(x):=(x^2 + x)\exp(x)$ on the $[-1,1]$ interval.

2. Make a graph of solutions to equations:

a) $\dot{x}=\exp(2t-x)$;

b) $\dot{x}=-\sqrt{3}t^2+2x$;

c) $\dot{x}=\frac{\frac{t}{20}+x}{x-t}$;

passing through the point $(1,2)$ on the range $t\in[0.5, 2.5]$.

### Python modules used ###

* matplotlib.pyplot
* numpy
* sympy
