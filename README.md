### Tasks in the project: ###

1. Create the graph of the 17th derivative of the function $f(x):=(x^2 + x)\exp(x)$ on the $ [- 1, 1] $ interval.

2. Make a graph of solutions to equations:

a) $ \dot {x} = \exp(2t-x) $;

b) $ \dot {x} = - \sqrt{3} t^2 + 2x $;

c) $ \dot {x} = \frac {\frac {t}{20} + x}{x-t} $;

passing through the point (1, 2) on the range $ t âˆˆ [0.5, 2.5] $.
